Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

Electricity flows as electric current—mobile charges moving through a closed loop under an electric field created by a voltage source.

- A source (battery/generator) sets up a voltage difference, establishing an electric field in the conductors almost instantly.
- In metals, electrons drift toward the positive terminal; conventional current is defined from positive to negative.
- The current I depends on the circuit’s opposition (resistance/impedance). For DC, Ohm’s law: I = V/R. In AC, capacitance and inductance also matter.
- Electrons move slowly (drift velocity), but energy is delivered quickly: the electromagnetic field around the wires carries energy from source to load.
- A complete (closed) path is required; opening the circuit stops current, while a short circuit allows excessive current limited only by source/internal resistance.
- DC: charges flow one way steadily. AC: charges oscillate back and forth; energy still flows from source to load each cycle.
