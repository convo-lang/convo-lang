Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

At its core, electricity in a circuit is about charges moving under the push of an electric field, and energy being delivered to components through that field. Here’s how it works, from the intuitive to the deeper details.

What a circuit is
- A circuit is a closed loop made of a source (like a battery or generator), conductors (wires), and loads (like a lamp or resistor).
- The source maintains a potential difference (voltage) between its terminals. That voltage creates an electric field that pushes charges around the loop when there’s a continuous path.

What actually moves
- Electric current is the rate of flow of charge (coulombs per second, measured in amperes).
- In metals, the mobile charges are electrons. In electrolytes, ions move. In semiconductors, both electrons and “holes” carry current.
- Conventional current direction is defined as flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. In metal wires, electrons actually drift the opposite way.

How the source drives current
- A battery uses chemical energy to separate charges, raising some charges in electrical potential energy. A generator does the same using motion and magnetic fields.
- When you complete the circuit (close a switch), the battery’s voltage sets up an electric field throughout the wires almost instantly (at a significant fraction of the speed of light). That field pushes on charges everywhere in the loop at once.

Drift speed vs signal speed
- Individual electrons drift surprisingly slowly—often millimeters per second—because they scatter off atoms as they move.
- The “signal” or the push (the electric field) propagates rapidly through the circuit, so the bulb lights almost immediately even though electrons move slowly. The charges were already throughout the wire; the field makes them all start drifting together.

Resistance and Ohm’s law
- Materials resist the motion of charges. Resistance turns electrical energy into heat as charges collide with atoms.
- Ohm’s law (V = I × R) relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) for many materials and components.
- Power delivered to a component is P = V × I = I²R = V²/R. That power often becomes light (in a lamp) or heat (in a resistor).

How current distributes in a circuit
- Series: Current is the same through all series elements; voltages add up.
- Parallel: Voltage is the same across each branch; currents split according to branch resistance (lower resistance gets more current).
- Conservation: In steady-state, the current that enters any junction equals the current that leaves it.

AC vs DC
- DC (from a battery) maintains roughly constant voltage and current direction.
- AC (from the grid) makes voltage and current alternate direction (e.g., sinusoidally at 50/60 Hz). Electrons mostly “wiggle” back and forth rather than travel around the entire loop.
- In AC, components like capacitors and inductors add frequency-dependent opposition to current (reactance), shaping how currents and voltages vary with frequency.

Capacitors and inductors (how they affect flow)
- Capacitor: Stores energy in an electric field. It resists sudden changes in voltage. In DC steady-state, no electrons cross the dielectric; during changes (or AC), current flows in the external circuit while electric fields carry displacement current across the gap.
- Inductor: Stores energy in a magnetic field. It resists sudden changes in current. Sudden changes create induced voltages opposing the change.
- Time constants describe how quickly circuits respond to changes (for example, RC and L/R).

Energy flow perspective (where the energy actually goes)
- Although charges move inside wires, most of the energy flows in the electromagnetic fields around the wires and into the load. The wires act as guides, shaping the fields.
- The source supplies energy to the fields; the fields deliver energy to components; components convert it (to light, motion, heat, etc.).
- This view explains why circuit geometry matters at high frequencies and why transmission lines and antennas behave the way they do.

What happens when you close a simple battery–resistor circuit
1) You close the switch, completing the loop.
2) The electric field establishes around the entire loop nearly instantly.
3) Charges everywhere in the wire begin to drift; current rises from zero toward its steady value determined by Ohm’s law.
4) The resistor converts electrical energy into heat at a rate P = VI; the battery’s chemical energy decreases accordingly.

Speeds and scales (typical numbers)
- Field/signal propagation in typical wiring is around 50–99% of the speed of light in vacuum, depending on the dielectric around the wire.
- Electron drift speed in household circuits is tiny, often less than a millimeter per second, even though the lamp lights effectively instantly.

Common clarifications
- Electrons vs conventional current: In metal wires, electrons flow from negative to positive, but we label current as flowing from positive to negative by convention. The math works either way.
- “Instantaneous” lighting: It looks instantaneous because the field pushes charges everywhere nearly at once, not because electrons race from the switch to the bulb.
- Birds on a wire: A bird touching only one wire is at nearly the same potential along both feet; there’s no significant voltage difference across its body, so little current flows through it.

In one sentence: Electricity flows through a circuit because a source creates an electric field that pushes charges around a closed loop; the charges drift slowly while the electromagnetic field carries energy rapidly to the loads, where it is converted into useful forms.
