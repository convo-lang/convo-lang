Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

Think of a circuit as a loop that gives electric charges a path to move and a source that pushes them. Here’s how the flow works, from simple picture to a bit more detail.

Basic picture
- A source (battery, generator, power supply) creates a voltage, which is a difference in electric potential between two points.
- When you provide a complete path (close the switch), an electric field sets up almost instantly along the wires.
- Charges in the conductor respond to that field: they start to drift, creating an electric current. In metals, the moving charges are electrons.
- Components in the path (like resistors, lamps, motors) convert electrical energy into heat, light, or motion.
- The current must have a return path back to the source. If the path is broken (open circuit), current stops.

Direction and what’s actually moving
- Conventional current is defined to flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the source.
- In metal wires, electrons move the opposite way (from negative to positive). In other media (electrolytes, semiconductors), ions or “holes” can carry current.
- Electrons drift slowly—millimeters per second—but the effect of closing the switch is felt throughout the circuit almost immediately because the electric field propagates through the circuit at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

What the source does
- A battery uses chemical reactions to separate charges, maintaining a voltage between its terminals.
- A generator uses motion in magnetic fields to do the same.
- The source does work on charges. That energy is delivered to components. The electrons themselves aren’t “used up”; they’re more like a conveyor belt carrying energy.

Resistance and Ohm’s law
- All real materials oppose current to some degree. This opposition is resistance.
- Ohm’s law relates the three key quantities: V = I × R.
  - Increase voltage, and current tends to rise.
  - Increase resistance, and current tends to fall.
- Power delivered to a component is P = V × I. In a lamp, that power becomes light and heat.

Series and parallel paths
- Series: one path, same current through each element; voltages add.
- Parallel: multiple paths, same voltage across each branch; currents add.
- A “short circuit” is a very low-resistance path that lets a large current flow; it can overheat wires or trip protection devices.

Energy flow (where the energy actually goes)
- The energy moves in the electromagnetic fields around the wires, guided by the conductors, and is transferred into components where it’s converted to heat, light, etc.
- The charges inside the wire enable and guide this transfer; they don’t carry the energy like trucks carrying cargo.

Direct current versus alternating current
- DC: current flows steadily one way (battery circuits).
- AC: current reverses direction periodically (power grid). In AC, capacitors and inductors matter:
  - Capacitors pass changing signals but block steady DC (after they charge).
  - Inductors pass steady DC but resist changes in current.

Open circuit, closed circuit, and ground
- Closed circuit: a complete loop; current flows.
- Open circuit: the loop is broken; current stops.
- “Ground” is usually just a reference point or a safety return path. Current doesn’t “seek ground” by nature; it follows whatever complete path is available back to its source.

A simple example
- Battery + switch + lamp + wires.
- Switch open: no complete path; lamp is off.
- Switch closed: the electric field establishes around the loop, electrons drift, current flows through the lamp’s filament, its resistance heats it until it glows.

Safety note
- It’s current through your body that harms you, driven by voltage and limited (or not) by resistance along the path. Household circuits can supply dangerous currents; fuses, breakers, and grounding are there to limit faults.

In short: a voltage source sets up an electric field in a closed loop; charges drift in response, forming a current; components resist and shape that current and convert electrical energy into other forms; and the energy is conveyed by the fields surrounding the circuit, not by “consuming” electrons.
