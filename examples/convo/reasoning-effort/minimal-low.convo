Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.


> assistant
Electricity flows through a circuit as moving charges (usually electrons) driven by a voltage source.

- The voltage source (battery, generator) creates an electric field that pushes electrons from its negative terminal toward its positive terminal.
- Electrons move through the conducting path (wires) and any components (resistors, bulbs, motors), transferring energy to them.
- In resistive elements, electrical energy converts to heat or light; in motors, to motion, etc.
- Current is the rate of charge flow. In metals, electrons physically drift slowly, but the electric field propagates nearly at light speed, so the effect is almost instantaneous.
- Conventional current is defined as flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, opposite the actual electron flow in metals.
- For continuous flow, the circuit must be closed (a complete loop). An open switch or break stops the current.
- The amount of current depends on the voltage and the total resistance (Ohm’s law: I = V/R).
