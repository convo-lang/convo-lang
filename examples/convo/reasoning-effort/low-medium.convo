Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

Electricity is the flow of electric charge through a closed path (a circuit). Here’s the gist of how it works:

- Source and voltage: A power source (battery, generator, power supply) separates charges and creates a voltage, or potential difference, between its terminals. This sets up an electric field in any connected conductors.

- Closing the loop: When the circuit is closed (e.g., a switch is on), the electric field pushes mobile charges in the conductor. In metals these charges are electrons. The resulting flow is electric current.

- Current direction: By convention, current is defined as flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. Electrons actually drift in the opposite direction. The field propagates through the circuit almost at the speed of light; the electrons themselves drift slowly.

- Energy transfer: The electric field does work on charges, transferring energy to components. Resistors and filaments convert electrical energy to heat (and light), motors to motion, LEDs to light, etc. Electrons aren’t “used up”; the source supplies energy, and charges circulate.

- Ohm’s law: For many components, current I = V/R. Higher voltage pushes more current; higher resistance limits current. Power delivered is P = VI.

- Series and parallel:
  - Series: the same current flows through each element; resistances add; voltage divides across components.
  - Parallel: each branch has the same voltage; currents split among branches and add at junctions.

- AC vs DC:
  - DC (batteries) provides a steady voltage; current flows one way.
  - AC (mains) alternates direction and magnitude; components like capacitors and inductors respond to frequency as well as magnitude.

- Simple example (battery, switch, bulb): The battery’s chemistry creates a voltage. Closing the switch lets the field establish throughout the loop, electrons drift from the battery’s negative terminal through the wire and bulb filament, heating it so it glows, and return to the positive terminal. The battery’s chemical energy is consumed to maintain the voltage; the charges continue circulating.

Key idea: a potential difference creates an electric field that drives charge around a closed path, and the field delivers energy to the components in that path.
