Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.


> assistant
Here’s a clear picture of how electricity flows through a circuit:

- What a circuit is:
  - A circuit is a closed loop made of a power source (like a battery or outlet), conductors (wires), and components that use energy (loads, like bulbs or motors). A switch opens or closes the loop.

- What makes charges move:
  - The power source creates a voltage (electric potential difference) between two points. This sets up an electric field in the conductors that pushes charge carriers.
  - In metals, the moving charge carriers are electrons. In electrolytes they’re ions; in semiconductors they’re electrons and holes.
  - Conventional current is defined as flowing from the source’s positive terminal to its negative; electron flow is in the opposite direction.

- How the flow behaves:
  - Current I is the rate of charge flow. Voltage V is the “push.” Resistance R opposes motion. They relate by Ohm’s law: V = I × R.
  - As electrons drift through a resistor or filament, they collide with atoms, transferring energy as heat and light (that’s why a bulb glows and wires don’t, because the bulb’s resistance is designed to be higher).
  - The actual drift speed of electrons is very slow, but the electric field that organizes their motion propagates through the circuit near the speed of light, so devices respond almost instantly when you close a switch.

- Energy flow:
  - The source supplies energy to charges; components convert that energy to light, heat, motion, etc. The electrical power delivered is P = V × I.
  - Energy moves through the electromagnetic field around the wires into the load; the charges inside the wire act as a medium that allows this energy transfer.

- Closed path requirement:
  - Current needs a complete loop. If the circuit is open (switch off, broken wire), there is no continuous path, so current stops.

- Series and parallel (basic rules):
  - Series: same current flows through each element; their voltages add up.
  - Parallel: same voltage across each branch; their currents add up.
  - Kirchhoff’s laws formalize this: the sum of currents into a node equals the sum out; the sum of voltage rises and drops around any loop is zero.

- DC vs AC:
  - DC (battery): current flows steadily in one direction.
  - AC (mains): charges oscillate back and forth; energy is still delivered to loads even though charges don’t travel far.

Quick example (battery and bulb):
- Closing the switch creates a closed loop. The battery’s voltage sets up an electric field throughout the circuit almost instantly.
- Electrons in the wire begin drifting; the filament’s higher resistance causes significant energy loss there, heating it until it glows.
- The current is determined mainly by the total resistance: I = V/R_total.
