- Validate demand and value proposition in Ohio (budget-focused used cars), competitors, and pricing strategy.
- Choose a structure and register: form an Ohio LLC/corp with the Secretary of State, get an EIN, open a business bank account.
- Secure licensing, permits, and taxes: Ohio motor vehicle dealer license (location/signage/bond/pre‑licensing), vendor’s license, collect/remit sales tax via Ohio Business Gateway, workers’ comp if hiring.
- Plan finances and risk: startup budget and working capital, floor‑plan or line of credit, dealer insurance (garage liability/lot), solid bookkeeping.
