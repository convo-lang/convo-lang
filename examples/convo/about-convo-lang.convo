Convo-Lang is an AI-native programming language designed specifically for prompt engineers and developers building applications with large language models (LLMs). Its core goal is to make developing LLM-powered applications easier, more structured, and highly portable across different LLM backends.

### What is Convo-Lang?

- **Purpose-Built for AI:** Unlike traditional programming languages, Convo-Lang is tailored to writing and orchestrating conversations, tools, and agent logic for LLM-based applications.
- **Uniform Syntax:** It provides a consistent syntax for working with all types of LLMs, so you don’t need to learn or customize for each model’s quirks.
- **Components:**
  - **Convo-Lang Language:** A scripting language for defining conversations, functions, variables, and more in a clear, readable way.
  - **Conversation Engine:** The runtime that executes Convo-Lang scripts, manages conversation context, calls tools/functions, and handles message formatting for various LLMs.

### How does Convo-Lang help you build agents?

- **Structure Conversations:** Easily define interactive, multi-modal dialogues between users and LLMs.
- **Create Agent Logic:** Write agent behaviors, such as calling functions, using variables, and handling conditional flows, all within a single language.
- **Tool Integration:** Seamless calling of external code (e.g., JavaScript, Python functions) as tools from within your conversations.
- **Extensible and Cross-Platform:** Use Convo-Lang from JavaScript, Python, command line, or directly in VSCode via extensions.

### Key Building Blocks

- **Content Messages:** Define what users, assistants, and systems say.
- **Variables:** Store and inject dynamic state in conversations.
- **Functions (Tools):** Define callable operations—can be pure Convo-Lang or externals in other languages.
- **Tags:** Add metadata or UX hints (e.g., suggestions) to messages and functions.
- **Comments:** Support for both coding (`//`) and documenting (`#`) comments.

### Example Basic Usage

```convo
\> define
username="Max"
\> assistant
Hello, \{{username}}! How can I help you today?
```

### Real-World Example: Doc

The tutorial assistant "Doc" is written entirely in Convo-Lang and showcases how you can create your own skilled conversational agents, complete with knowledge, tooling, and interactive logic.

### How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

Convo-Lang scripts are parsed and loaded into a conversation context. Messages (with dynamic variables evaluated) are sent to LLMs using adapters that translate between Convo-Lang format and the LLM’s native message format. If functions/tools are called, Convo-Lang can execute them internally or externally and feed responses back to the conversation seamlessly.

**In short:**
Convo-Lang lets you program AI agents and conversations as first-class citizens, making prompt engineering and agent development straightforward, powerful, and maintainable.
