Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

Electricity is the flow of electric charges, usually electrons, through a closed path called a circuit.

- Source: A power source (battery or generator) provides a voltage (electric potential difference) that pushes charges.
- Conductors: Wires provide a low-resistance path for electrons to move.
- Load: Devices like bulbs or motors resist the flow and convert electrical energy into light, heat, or motion.
- Control: Switches open (stop) or close (allow) the circuit.

In a simple series circuit:
- Electrons leave the negative terminal of the source, move through the wire, pass through the load (doing work and losing potential), and return to the positive terminal.
- The same current flows through every component; voltages across components add up to the source voltage.

In a parallel circuit:
- The voltage across each branch is the same.
- Current splits among branches according to their resistance; lower resistance gets more current.

Current flows only when the circuit is closed; resistance and voltage together set the current (Ohm’s law: I = V/R).
