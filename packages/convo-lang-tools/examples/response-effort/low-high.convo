Describe how electricity flows through a circuit.

- A source (battery or generator) creates a potential difference (voltage) between two points.
- When a closed conductive path connects them, an electric field is established around the loop.
- That field pushes mobile charges: in metals, electrons move; in electrolytes, ions; in semiconductors, electrons and holes.
- Conventional current is defined from + to −; electrons in metals drift the opposite way and slowly, while the field propagates much faster.
- Collisions with the material cause resistance, limiting current: I = V / R. Components drop voltage and convert electrical energy to heat, light, or motion: P = V × I.
- Conservation laws apply: currents at a junction sum to zero (KCL), and voltage rises equal drops around any loop (KVL).
- Open circuit (broken path) → no current; short circuit (very low resistance path) → very large current.
- DC keeps one direction; AC reverses direction periodically.
