About Biobeat

Biobeat is revolutionizing hypertension diagnosis and management with its pioneering, FDA-cleared, cuff-less 24-hour blood pressure monitoring system. We are committed to empowering healthcare providers and patients with accurate, actionable blood pressure data, enabling precise diagnosis and personalized management programs for hypertension.


At the core of Biobeat's innovation is a proprietary, patented PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensor integrated into a comfortable, non-invasive chest patch. This medical-grade device is the first of its kind to receive FDA clearance for cuff-less 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. It captures vital sign data throughout a full day and night, offering a comprehensive view of blood pressure patterns, including during sleep, without the discomfort or disruption of traditional cuff-based methods.
