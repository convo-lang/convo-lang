SENIOR BACKEND DEVELOPER

SUMMARY
I am a Senior Backend Developer focused on backend systems, distributed microservices, and high-throughput data pipelines. I have hands-on experience developing backend services in Python and building RESTful APIs across microservice architectures. I have worked with relational and document databases, caching, and ingestion pipelines to address schema, indexing, and performance concerns. I apply software design principles, clean architecture, and testing practices while using Docker and message-based components in production environments.
