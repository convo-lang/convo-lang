# Resume Generator

A multi-agent Convo-Lang example that:

- analyzes a job description
- analyzes a candidate profile
- matches requirements
- generates a tailored resume
- evaluates whether applying is recommended

Python is used only to orchestrate agent execution.
All decision logic lives in `.convo` files.
