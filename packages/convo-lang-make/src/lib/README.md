# Convo Make
`convo make` is a generative build system that follows many of the principles of `make`.

`.convo` files and Markdown files are used to generate outputs that could be anything from React components to images or videos.

It provides for a way to define generated applications and content in a very declarative way that is repeatable and easy to modify.

Token usage and time required to generate large applications is decreased since outputs are cached and generated in parallel.
